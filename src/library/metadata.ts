      about:
        'H. P. Lovecraft was an American writer of weird, science, fantasy, and horror fiction, best known for his creation of the Cthulhu Mythos. Though the worst of his writings are of questionable quality and often marred by racist themes, his best works captured and expressed a sense of cosmic horror - the horror of the unknownable and of human insignificance. This style of "Lovecraftian horror" has had an enduring cultural impact comparable to few other authors of fiction.',

Wodehouse was an English writer and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century, best know for his stories featuring the feather-brained Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet, Jeeves.
